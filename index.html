        <h4>Overview:</h4>
        <p>Greetings my fellow programmers. Welcome to my humble recipe website.</p>
        <p>This website contains recipes for 3 dishes that I have loved throughout my life, and continue to love and enjoy to this day. I hope you find them as delicious as I did.</p>
        <p>Of course I count greatly on each and every one of you putting your own personal touches on it, and giving a taste, texture, and emotion value unique only to you and your loved ones.</p>
        <p>This website is not that old, and God willing, will continue to recive updates going forward. Should you ever wish to contribute to this humble little project, or to just see what's gone in it, feel free to visite it's <a href="https://github.com/temor01/odin-recipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><code>repository</code></a>.</p>
        <p id="last_p">I greatly appreciate your visit, wish you all the best, and hope that run into a plethora challenges, problems, and bugs on your programming journey, and after overcoming each and every one of them, reach a level of experience and competence unimaginable to you today. Best of luck, see you on the path.</p>
